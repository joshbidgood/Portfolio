### Cash Summary

A replacement to the old paper-based system that had been in use. This spreadsheet now assists staff with counting the register money at the end of the day. Benefits of this spreadsheet include:

- Facilitating a faster exit from the store at the end of day. 
- Permitting the owner to review the change situation in a central location and make decisions about when/where change is required for each shop.
- The old paper records were formerly discarded after some weeks, but this new system promotes the opportunity to hold a permanent record of these values for any further data investigation or auditing purposes.
- Less calculation errors associated with counting multiple registers
